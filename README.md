## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Box Model
- Flexbox
- Google Fonts ("Outfit" font family)
- Custom styling for card layout and typography

### What I Learned

This project helped me reinforce concepts of responsive design and CSS properties. I practiced using Flexbox to center elements on the page and applied Google Fonts for custom typography.

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to:

- Dive deeper into responsive design and media queries
- Experiment with CSS Grid for more complex layouts
- Explore advanced typography and accessibility best practices

### Useful Resources

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Provided the "Outfit" font used in this project.
